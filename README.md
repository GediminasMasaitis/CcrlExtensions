# TLCV extensions

The extensions consist of 2 parts:

- A .js script that modifies TLCV files to query one or more kibitzers and showing/printing their evaluations.
- A .NET backend capable of running those kibitzers locally in the background.

Only one TLCV tab can be open at a time in the browser for these extensions to work.

This is what it looks like to watch a game with two engines (StockFish 13 and StockFish 16.1) as kibitzers:

## How to setup

You can find the frontend script and a few pre-compiled binaries (Windows, Linux, macOS) in the [latest release](https://github.com/GediminasMasaitis/TlcvExtensions/releases/latest).

Alternatively, you can always build the backend yourself (.NET 8.0 required) and take the script from the repository ([`src/front/tlcvExtensions.js`](src/front/tlcvExtensions.js))

### Front end

1. Install a usercript runner. Only tested on Firefox and Violentmonkey plugin.
2. Copy [`tlcvExtensions.js`](src/front/tlcvExtensions.js) into a new userscript and save changes.

### Back end

1. Adjust kibitzer path(s) in `appsettings.json` to your local engine(s) path(s).
2. Execute the binary (or build and run the project if you're not using a pre-built one).
